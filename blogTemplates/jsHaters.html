    Intro

    What is going on here with all of these people hating on JS so much? This
    is a great question and I am not here to satisfy you. Especially
    professionally. No, I am not going to be professional at all I mean it is
    ridiculous to hold back right now. We have a plethora of absolutely
    unbelievably smart individuals with years of experience writing and
    engineering programs in far more advanced languages than JS by the way,
    and god forbid they are people that unit test...
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If you are reading this right now and you find that you are comparing
    yourself to who I am describing and especially the unit testing part...
    Are you one of those individuals? Okay, if you are please leave.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Oh wait no you need to hear this too. So, back to what I was saying here..
    These non unit testing, super smart individuals are coming down hard on us
    JS fans. And it seems that if you have been paying attention to who some
    of these shlock brains are you will know that it is true. Most of them are
    advanced software engineers with diverse backgrounds a matter of fact.
    This is important to note and let me tell you why this is.

    How many JavaScript writers can mash out a function using binary search
    right now without looking up what binary search even means?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>Haha, are you able to do this?</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    If you can't.. Maybe you are not sure what binary search even is. That's
    okay, because we don't need to understand performance on a fine grain
    level such as this. Especially knowing we have all these really great
    searching methods in Javascript
