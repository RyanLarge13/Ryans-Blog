  <p>What is going on here with all of these people hating on JS so much? This is a great question and I am not here to satisfy you. Especially professionally.
    No, I am not going to be professional at all I mean it is ridiculous to hold back right now. We have a plethora of absolutely unbelievably smart individuals
    with years of experience writing and engineering programs in far more advanced languages than JS by the way, and god forbid they are people that unit test...
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>If you are reading this right now and you find that you are comparing yourself to who I am describing and especially the unit testing part. Are you one of those individuals? Okay, if you are please leave.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Oh wait no you need to hear this too. So, back to what I was saying here.. These non unit testing super smart individuals are coming down hard on us JS fans. And it seems that if you have been paying attention to who some of these shlock brains are you will know that it is true. Most of them are advanced software engineers with diverse backgrounds a matter of fact. This is important to note and let me tell you why this is.</p>
