      Intro
    </h2>
    <p>
      What is going on here with all of these people hating on JS so much? This
      is a great question and I am not here to satisfy you. Especially
      professionally. No, I am not going to be professional at all I mean it is
      ridiculous to hold back right now. We have a plethora of absolutely
      unbelievably smart individuals with years of experience writing and
      engineering programs in far more advanced languages than JS by the way,
      and god forbid they are people that unit test...
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you are reading this right now and you find that you are comparing
      yourself to who I am describing and especially the unit testing part...
      Are you one of those individuals? Okay, if you are please leave.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Oh wait no you need to hear this too. So, back to what I was saying here..
      These non unit testing, super smart individuals are coming down hard on us
      JS fans. And it seems that if you have been paying attention to who some
      of these shlock brains are you will know that it is true. Most of them are
      advanced software engineers with diverse backgrounds a matter of fact.
      This is important to note and let me tell you why this is.

      JS Makes Things Easy

    <p>
      How many JavaScript writers can mash out a function using binary search
      right now without looking up what binary search even means?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Haha, are you able to do this?</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      If you can't.. Maybe you are not sure what binary search even is. That's
      okay, because we don't need to understand performance on a fine grain
      level such as this. Especially knowing we have all these really great
      searching methods in Javascript
