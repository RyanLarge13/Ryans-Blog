      Intro
    </h2>
    <p>Lets talk about data types in JavaScript.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We will go over two different data types in JS...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Primitive Types</li>
      <li>Object Types</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But before we talk about these we are going to first talk about the method
      JavaScript uses to define its types

      Dynamically Typed Language
    </h2>
    <p>
      Javascript is a
      <strong style="font-weight: 600">dynamically</strong> typed language. This
      is extremely important to understand so let me make it clear with examples
      of what I mean by a dynamically typed language and how it works. There are
      two different ways a language can determine its types of variables,
      objects, structs and more:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamically</li>
      <li>Statically</li>
    </ul>
    <h3

      Statically Typed
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a statically typed variable in a language like
      <span style="font-style: italic">C++, C, Java, Go, Rust,</span> etc..
      etc.... etc.......
    </p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #222;
        color: #fff;
        width: max-content;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: 1em 0.25em;
      "
    >
      <code>
        <span style="color: red">int</span> myNumber
        <span style="color: aqua">= </span> <span style="color: pink">24</span>;
      </code>
      <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.c</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      What are you looking at here? Lets break it apart. We are going start by
      reading this code snippet backwards. I am using C in this example, and
      many languages such as JavaScript, C++ and more use the same conventions
      as in C where a ";" is used at the end of a statement for what they call a
      <span style="font-style: italic">statement delimiter</span>, helping a
      compiler determine the end of one statement of code to the next. This is
      where we will start.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      - Just to the left of our semicolon we see a numeric value. Here we put
      the value 24.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      - To the left of this we have our assignment operator "=", this will take
      out numeric value on the right side of the equal sign and place it within
      a variable name that we create.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      - To the left of the assignment operator we give our value a name. We are
      going to name the value of 24 as the text "myNumber". The equal sign in
      going to place 24 inside of myNumber
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      - Finally we have the part of this statement that actually matters in this
      article. "int"..
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      So, what is int? Simple, int is out static type definition. We are telling
      the compiler that our variable myNumber is of a specific type. An integer
      type.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Incase you did not already realize int is short for integer, it is. As we
      can clearly determine as humans without much effort the value of our
      variable myNumber is a number (eg. 24) a computer needs to determine this
      as well. It needs to know what type our value will be that our variable
      holds. There are a few reasons we want to specify the type of a variable,
      but we will go over more of that later. For now, understand that before
      initializing a variable we need to define its type in a statically typed
      language like C.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Why is this? We tell the compiler what type our variables value is so
      knows exactly where and how to store our variable in memory.

      Dynamically Typed
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a dynamically typed variable in a language like
      <span style="font-style: italic"
        >JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, ect. ect...</span
      >
    </p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #222;
        color: #fff;
        width: max-content;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: 1em 0.25em;
      "
    >
      <code>
        <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber
        <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
        <span style="color: pink">24</span>;
      </code>
      <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      So what is the difference here from the former code snippet? There is a
      minor difference right? Our type is different. This code snippet is
      written in JavaScript and the important thing to note here is that our
      type "const" is actually not a type at all.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      So what is const? It is a reserve word in many languages and a way to say
      "hey, this variable myNumber is not allowed to be reassigned to any new
      value, EVER.". So we are no longer allowed to say myNumber = 10 ever again
      within scope.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Anyway let's come to what's important here. Sinse const is not a type,
      this means that in Javascript and many other dynamically types languages,
      our myNumber variable is not assigned to be of a certain type at all.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      So how does our compiler, (or interpreter in the case with JavaScript)
      know what type our myNumber variable is?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      You've guessed it correctly if you think that it is figured out on its
      own. For JavaScript there is a specific time and place for this operation
      to take place as it is a just in time (jit) compilation technique used
      when interpreting JavaScript and on the optimization phase we spend some
      extra time analyzing different variables and evaluating past and present
      implementations of our variable to better understand it's evolution within
      the program to figure out what type our variable actually is.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This approach therefore creates an environment where types do not need to
      be specified within the language itself because at compile time types will
      be assigned by the interpreter or compiler for us instead.

      Primitive Types
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now we have gone over some basic ideas on how JavaScript and other
      languages might handle types. Let's now dig into the grouping of data
      types in JavaScript

      Primitive Types
    </h3>
    <p>let's list out out Primitive Types after a brief definition</p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-weight: bold">
      Primitive types are the basic building blocks of a programming language.
      They reprisent simple values such as integers, strings, booleans and are
      not composed of other data types
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integers</li>
      <li>Floating point numbers</li>
      <li>Booleans</li>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Symbols >= ES6</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-style: italic">Integers</p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #222;
        color: #fff;
        width: max-content;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: 1em 0.25em;
      "
    >
      <code>
        <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber
        <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
        <span style="color: pink">24</span>;
      </code>
      <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Integer types are determined by reading the binary value of a variable,
      shifting each value over by 1 bit and attaching a 0 at the end
      representing a small integer type
    </p>
    <br />
    <p style="font-style: italic">Floating point numbers</p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: #222;
        color: #fff;
        width: max-content;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 10px;
        margin: 1em 0.25em;
      "
    >
      <code>
        <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber
        <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
        <span style="color: pink">24.74356</span>;
      </code>
      <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Floating type integers are determined by reading the binary value of
      your variable and a bit pointer with a value greater than 0 in the case of small integer types directed towards a more complex object where a fraction, exponent and sign but are stored for precision and efficiency
    </p>
    <p>
      Primitive types in JavaScript are dynamically determined like we
      established earlier
