    Intro
  </h2>
  <p>Lets talk about data types in JavaScript.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will go over two different data types in JS...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Primitive Types</li>
    <li>Object Types</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But before we talk about these we are going to first talk about the
    method JavaScript uses to define its types
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: 600; margin-top: 1.25em">
    Dynamically Typed Language
  </h2>
  <p>
    Javascript is a
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">dynamically</strong> typed
    language. This is extremely important to understand so let me make
    it clear with examples of what I mean by a dynamically typed
    language and how it works. There are two different ways a language
    can determine its types of variables, objects, structs and more:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamically</li>
    <li>Statically</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="
                font-weight: 600;
                margin-top: 1.25em;
                color: #444;
                font-style: underline;
            ">
    Statically Typed
  </h3>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a statically typed variable in a language like
    <span style="font-style: italic">C++, C, Java, Go, Rust,</span>
    etc.. etc.... etc.......
  </p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">int</span> myNumber
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: #0f6">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.c</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    What are you looking at here? Lets break it apart. We are going
    start by reading this code snippet backwards. I am using C in this
    example, and many languages such as JavaScript, C++ and more use the
    same conventions as in C where a ";" is used at the end of a
    statement for what they call a
    <span style="font-style: italic">statement delimiter</span>, helping
    a compiler determine the end of one statement of code to the next.
    This is where we will start.
  </p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      - Just to the left of our semicolon we see a numeric value. Here
      we put the value 24.
    </li>
    <li>
      - To the left of this we have our assignment operator "=", this
      will take out numeric value on the right side of the equal sign
      and place it within a variable name that we create.
    </li>
    <li>
      - To the left of the assignment operator we give our value a
      name. We are going to name the value of 24 as the text
      "myNumber". The equal sign in going to place 24 inside of
      myNumber
    </li>
    <li>
      - Finally we have the part of this statement that actually
      matters in this article. "int"..
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    So, what is int? Simple, int is out static type definition. We are
    telling the compiler that our variable myNumber is of a specific
    type. An integer type.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Incase you did not already realize int is short for integer, it is.
    As we can clearly determine as humans without much effort the value
    of our variable myNumber is a number (eg. 24) a computer needs to
    determine this as well. It needs to know what type our value will be
    that our variable holds. There are a few reasons we want to specify
    the type of a variable, but we will go over more of that later. For
    now, understand that before initializing a variable we need to
    define its type in a statically typed language like C.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Why is this? We tell the compiler what type our variables value is
    so knows exactly where and how to store our variable in memory.
  </p>
  <h3 style="
                font-weight: 600;
                margin-top: 1.25em;
                color: #444;
                font-style: underline;
            ">
    Dynamically Typed
  </h3>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a dynamically typed variable in a language
    like
    <span style="font-style: italic">JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, ect. ect...</span>
  </p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: #0f6">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    So what is the difference here from the former code snippet? There
    is a minor difference right? Our type is different. This code
    snippet is written in JavaScript and the important thing to note
    here is that our type "const" is actually not a type at all.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So what is const? Const It is a reserve word in many languages and a
    way to say "hey, this variable myNumber is not allowed to be
    reassigned to any new value, EVER.". So we are no longer allowed to
    say myNumber = 10, or myNumber = 24, or perform any other
    reassigning operation ever again within the scope of this variable.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Anyway let's talk about what matters here. Since const is not a
    type, this means that in Javascript and many other dynamically types
    languages, our myNumber variable is not assigned to be of a certain
    type at all.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So how does our compiler, (or interpreter in the case with
    JavaScript) know what type our "myNumber" variable is?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    You've guessed it correctly if you think that it is figured out on
    its own. For JavaScript there is a time and place for this operation
    to take place during compilation and interpreting. Normally for a
    typical Javascript Engine there is an optimization phase where the
    engine takes the time analyzing your variables and evaluate past and
    present implementations of them to better understand a variables
    evolution within the program and properly assign it a type.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    It is extremely important to know that at the end of the day, before
    machine code and before being processed by the cpu, each variable
    must have a type. The JavaScript engine running in your browser will
    do this based on the values that you assign to your variables and
    how they are used within the context of the application or website
    you are building. This allows for dynamic type inference at runtime
    therefore creating a unique and user friendly way to write code. Is
    this good or bad? We will talk more on that later.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This approach therefore creates an environment where types do not
    need to be specified within the language itself because at compile
    time types will be assigned by the Javascript engine interpreter for
    us instead.
  </p>

    Primitive Types
  </h2>
  <p>
    Now we have gone over some basic ideas on how JavaScript and other
    languages might handle types, let's dig into the grouping of the two
    major data types in JavaScript
  </p>
  <h3 style="
                font-weight: 600;

                font-style: underline;
            ">
    Primitive Types
  </h3>
  <p>let's list out out Primitive Types after a brief definition</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-weight: bold">
    Primitive types are the basic building blocks of a programming
    language. They represent simple values such as integers, strings,
    booleans and are not composed of other data types such as a struct.
    We will go over the types of these variables and how a Javascript
    engine assigns these types. Essentially all examples will be in the
    context of Javascript. All JavaScript values are determined by
    literals and syntax.. Scary I would say
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integers</li>
    <li>Floating point numbers</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
    <li>Null</li>
    <li>Symbols >= ES6</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="font-style: italic" font-weight: bold;>Integers</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: #0f6">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Integers are interpreted as numeric literals. As the engine parses
    your program and comes across the value 2, the engine will tag this
    variable with the integer type by knowing that if there are no
    single or double quotes around the number and as long as it is a
    valid number and not a character of some sort the engine will be
    pretty confident you have assigned "myNumber" to equal a number and
    tag the variable with that type
  </p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-style: italic" font-weight: bold;>Floating point numbers</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myFloat
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: #0f6">24.74356</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    As like integers, in JavaScript Engines will first look at the value
    you have stored in myFloat and check if it is surrounded by single
    or double quotes and if it is not a character. Additionally the
    engine will notice the period within the numeric literal indicating
    it should be of a floating point number
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic" font-weight: bold;>Strings</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myString
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 251, 0)">"Hey, I am a string"</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    I JavaScript, strings can be wrapped in both single and double
    quotes. The engine will directly understand that the value assigned
    to your variable is a string by the double or single quotes around
    your value. Another great example of type inference by syntax
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic" font-weight: bold;>Boolean</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myNameIsRyan
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 140)">true</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Booleans are tagged with a type by the literal text of your value.
    true and false are reserve words unless wrapped in single or double
    quotes. So the JavaScript engine can quickly determine the type of a
    true or false Boolean value
  </p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-style: italic" font-weight: bold;>Undefined</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> uninitializedType
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: rgb(183, 0, 255)">undefined</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Undefined is a somewhat unique value in JavaScript. It means that the variable you create does not yet have a value. Such as initializing a variable with no predetermined value. If you attempt to access a variable that does not have a value in JavaScript "undefined" will be returned.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>The JavaScript engine will tag your variable with undefined if you do not explicitly set a value, or use the key word undefined</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Null</p>
  <div style="
                background-color: #222;
                color: #fff;
                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;
            ">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> whatIsThis
      <span style="color: aqua">= </span>
      <span style="color: rgb(183, 0, 255)">null</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Null is designed to tell the JavaScript engine that your variable is meant to hold no value or that a function will return no value. Unlike undefined null must be explicitly set.

    Primitive Types
  </h3>
  <p>let's list out out JavaScripts Object types and explain them after a brief definition</p>
  <br />
  <p style="font-weight: bold">
    As in our primitive types section we will be covering object types in the context of JavaScript.
    Object types unlike primitive types are composed of other data types. They can be composed of other object types or primitive type data types and often times allow for a more dynamic approach to handling and manipulating data in a programming language. We will be discussing...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Functions</li>

  <br />
  <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">JavaScript Objects</p>

                width: 50%;
                padding: 10px;
                border-radius: 10px;
                margin: 1em 0.25em;

      <span style="color: rgb(183, 0, 255)">null</span>;
    </code>
    <p style="font-size: 0.75em; color: #aaa">.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    JavaScript Objects are an extremely convenient and special data type in JavaScript. There are multiple types of objects that can be created in JavaScript, to name a few..
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Object literals</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>And even Functions are treated like objects in JS</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>To simplify the definition of an object in JS we will first cover Object Literals.</p>
  <p>Object literals are a data structure that can hold a collection of key value pairs. We can call these key value pairs as an objects properties. Each property can be looked up by its key and a value returned for whatever value you assigned to that key. See the example above.</p>
  <br />
  <p>You can name a key whatever you please in the object as long as it follows the standard variable naming conventions in JavaScript. A key in an object so to speak, is like a variable name and the value is well... the value you assign to your variable name. Think of it as creating multiple variables inside of a block.</p>
  <br />
  <p>The values you assign to each key can be any valid data structure in the JavaScript language. In other words you can assign a key to be OR return virtually anything. This includes all primitive data types we went over in the previous section and includes all Object data types that we will cover more in depth in this section, such as arrays, other objects, functions or return values from functions</p>
  <br />
  <p>As you can see, JS objects are pretty cool. And if we think about it a little longer we realize we can do some pretty cool things with this data structure</p>
