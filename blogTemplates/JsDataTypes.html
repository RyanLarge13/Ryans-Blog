  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;">Intro</h2>
  <p>Lets talk about data types in JavaScript.</p>
  <br>
  <p>We will go over two different types of types of data in JS...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Primitive Types</li>
    <li>Object Types</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thank goodness there are only two major data type groups in this language.. Well, any language really. But JavaScript can
    sometimes be a bit special for some reasons we will also cover in this article. So lets dive in
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size: 1.25em;  font-weight: 600;
  margin-top: 1.25em;">Dynamically Typed Language</h2>
  <p>Javascript is a <strong style="font-weight: 600;">dynamically</strong> typed language. This is extremely important to understand so let me make it clear with examples
    of what I mean by a dynamically typed language and how it works. There are two different ways a language can determine its types of variables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamically</li>
    <li>Statically</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="font-weight: 600;
  margin-top: 1.25em;
  color: #444;
  font-style: underline;">Statically Typed</h3>
  <p>Here is an example of a statically typed variable in a language like <span style="font-style: italic;">C++, C, Java, Go, Rust,</span> etc.. etc.... etc....... the cool languages you know? And don't sit here judging, I know I left out a lot of languages that are cool and statically typed if you do know a little about what I mean, and of course if I spent the time writing them out instead of writing this last sentence defending my position for not writing these other languages out I could have avoided writing this long nonsense last sentence, but nah...</p>
  <div style="background-color: #222; color: #fff; width: max-content; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1em 0;">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">int</span> myNumber <span style="color: aqua;">= </span> <span style="color: purple;">24</span>;
    </code>
  </div>
  <p>What are you looking at here? Lets break it apart. in this short code snippet basically you are going to need to read it backwards. I am using C in this example, and many languages such as JavaScript, C++ and more use the same conventions as this where a ";" is used at the end of a statement for what they call a <span style="font-style: italic;">statement delimiter</span>, helping a compiler determine the end of one statement of code to the next.</p>
  <br>
  <p> - Now, just to the right of our semicolon we see a value. Here we put the value 24.</p>
  <br>
  <p> - To the left of this we have our assignment operator "="</p>
  <br>
  <p> - And to the left of that we name our value. We are going to name the value of 24 and its address in memory as the text "myNumber"</p>
  <br>
  <p> - Finally we have the part of this statement that actually matters. "int"..</p>

  <p>Here is an example of a dynamically typed variable in a language like <span style="font-style: italic;">JavaScript, Python, ect.... ect.......</span></p>
  <p>Don' say it.</p>
  <div style="background-color: #222; color: #fff; width: max-content; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1em 0;">
    <code>
      <span style="color: red">const</span> myNumber <span style="color: aqua;">= </span> <span style="color: purple;">24</span>;
    </code>
  </div>
</body>
