  <p>Lets talk about data types in JavaScript.</p>
  <br />
  <p>We will go over two different data types in JS...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Primitive Types</li>
    <li>Object Types</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    But before we talk about these we are going to first talk about the method
    JavaScript uses to define its types
  </p>

  <h2 id="dynamically-typed-language">
    Dynamically Typed Language
  </h2>
  <p>
    Javascript is a dynamically typed language. This is
    extremely important to understand so let me make it clear with examples of
    what I mean by a dynamically typed language and how it works. There are two
    different ways a language can determine its types of variables, objects,
    structs and more:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dynamically</li>
    <li>Statically</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="statically-typed">
    Statically Typed
  </h3>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a statically typed variable in a language like
    <span>C++, C, Java, Go, Rust,</span>
    etc.. etc.... etc.......
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">int</span> myNumber
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="num">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.c</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    What are you looking at here? Lets break it apart. We are going start by
    reading this code snippet backwards. I am using C in this example, and many
    languages such as JavaScript, C++ and more use the same conventions as in C
    where a ";" is used at the end of a statement for what they call a
    <span>statement delimiter</span>, helping a
    compiler determine the end of one statement of code to the next. This is
    where we will start.
  </p>
  <br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      Just to the left of our semicolon we see a numeric value. Here we put the
      value 24.
    </li>
    <li>
      To the left of this we have our assignment operator "=", this will take
      out numeric value on the right side of the equal sign and place it within a
      variable name that we create.
    </li>
    <li>
      To the left of the assignment operator we give our value a name. We are
      going to name the value of 24 as the text "myNumber". The equal sign in
      going to place 24 inside of myNumber
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally we have the part of this statement that actually matters in this
      article. "int"..
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
  <p>
    So, what is int? Simple, int is out static type definition. We are telling
    the compiler that our variable myNumber is of a specific type. An integer
    type.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Incase you did not already realize int is short for integer, it is. As we can
    clearly determine as humans without much effort the value of our variable
    myNumber is a number (eg. 24) a computer needs to determine this as well. It
    needs to know what type our value will be that our variable holds. There are
    a few reasons we want to specify the type of a variable, but we will go over
    more of that later. For now, understand that before initializing a variable
    we need to define its type in a statically typed language like C.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Why is this? We tell the compiler what type our variables value is so knows
    exactly where and how to store our variable in memory.
  </p>
  <h3 id="dynamically-typed">
    Dynamically Typed
  </h3>
  <p>
    Here is an example of a dynamically typed variable in a language like
    <span>JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, ect. ect...</span>
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myNumber
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="num">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    So what is the difference here from the former code snippet? There is a minor
    difference right? Our type is different. This code snippet is written in
    JavaScript and the important thing to note here is that our type "const" is
    actually not a type at all.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So what is const? Const It is a reserve word in many languages and a way to
    say "hey, this variable myNumber is not allowed to be reassigned to any new
    value, EVER.". So we are no longer allowed to say myNumber = 10, or myNumber
    = 24, or perform any other reassigning operation ever again within the scope
    of this variable.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Anyway let's talk about what matters here. Since const is not a type, this
    means that in Javascript and many other dynamically types languages, our
    myNumber variable is not assigned to be of a certain type at all.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    So how does our compiler, (or interpreter in the case with JavaScript) know
    what type our "myNumber" variable is?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    You've guessed it correctly if you think that it is figured out on its own.
    For JavaScript there is a time and place for this operation to take place
    during compilation and interpreting. Normally for a typical Javascript Engine
    there is an optimization phase where the engine takes the time analyzing your
    variables and evaluate past and present implementations of them to better
    understand a variables evolution within the program and properly assign it a
    type.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    It is extremely important to know that at the end of the day, before machine
    code and before being processed by the cpu, each variable must have a type.
    The JavaScript engine running in your browser will do this based on the
    values that you assign to your variables and how they are used within the
    context of the application or website you are building. This allows for
    dynamic type inference at runtime therefore creating a unique and user
    friendly way to write code. Is this good or bad? We will talk more on that
    later.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    This approach therefore creates an environment where types do not need to be
    specified within the language itself because at compile time types will be
    assigned by the Javascript engine interpreter for us instead.
  </p>

  <h2 id="js-types">
    JavaScript Types
  </h2>
  <p>
    Now we have gone over some basic ideas on how JavaScript and other languages
    might handle types, let's dig into the grouping of the two major data types
    in JavaScript
  </p>
  <h3 id="primative-types">
    Primitive Types
  </h3>
  <p>let's list out out Primitive Types after a brief definition</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Primitive types are the basic building blocks of a programming language. They
    represent simple values such as integers, strings, booleans and are not
    composed of other data types such as a struct. We will go over the types of
    these variables and how a Javascript engine assigns these types. Essentially
    all examples will be in the context of Javascript. All JavaScript values are
    determined by literals and syntax.. Scary I would say
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Integers</li>
    <li>Floating point numbers</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
    <li>Null</li>
    <li>Symbols >= ES6</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="integers">Integers</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myNumber
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="num">24</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Integers are interpreted as numeric literals. As the engine parses your
    program and comes across the value 2, the engine will tag this variable with
    the integer type by knowing that if there are no single or double quotes
    around the number and as long as it is a valid number and not a character of
    some sort the engine will be pretty confident you have assigned "myNumber" to
    equal a number and tag the variable with that type
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 id="floating-point">Floating point numbers</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myFloat
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="num">24.74356</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    As like integers, in JavaScript Engines will first look at the value you have
    stored in myFloat and check if it is surrounded by single or double quotes
    and if it is not a character. Additionally the engine will notice the period
    within the numeric literal indicating it should be of a floating point number
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 id="strings">Strings</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myString
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="str">"Hey, I am a string"</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    I JavaScript, strings can be wrapped in both single and double quotes. The
    engine will directly understand that the value assigned to your variable is a
    string by the double or single quotes around your value. Another great
    example of type inference by syntax
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 id="booleans" class="h4">Booleans</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myNameIsRyan
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="boo">true</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myNameIsRyan
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="boo">false</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Booleans are tagged with a type by the literal text of your value. true and
    false are reserve words unless wrapped in single or double quotes. So the
    JavaScript engine can quickly determine the type of a true or false Boolean
    value
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 id="undefined">Undefined</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> uninitializedType
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="undefined">undefined</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Undefined is a somewhat unique value in JavaScript. It means that the
    variable you create does not yet have a value. Such as initializing a
    variable with no predetermined value. If you attempt to access a variable
    that does not have a value in JavaScript "undefined" will be returned.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The JavaScript engine will tag your variable with undefined if you do not
    explicitly set a value, or use the key word undefined
  </p>
  <br />
  <h4 id="null">Null</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> whatIsThis
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span class="null">null</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Null is designed to tell the JavaScript engine that your variable is meant to
    hold no value or that a function will return no value. Unlike undefined null
    must be explicitly set.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3 id="object-types">
    Object Types
  </h3>
  <p>
    let's list out out JavaScripts Object types and explain them after a brief
    definition
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    As in our primitive types section we will be covering object types in the
    context of JavaScript. Object types unlike primitive types are composed of
    other data types. They can be composed of other object types or primitive
    type data types and often times allow for a more dynamic approach to handling
    and manipulating data in a programming language. We will be discussing...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <h3 id="javascript-objects">JavaScript Objects</h3>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> myNewObject
      <span class="equal">= </span> <span class="pink">&#123;</span>
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">myName: <span class="str">"Ryan"</span>,</span>
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">myAge: <span class="num">24</span></span>
      <br>
      <span class="pink">&#125;</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    JavaScript Objects are an extremely convenient and special data type in
    JavaScript. There are multiple kinds of objects that can be created in
    JavaScript, to name a few..
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Object literals</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>And even Functions are treated like objects in JS</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>
    To simplify the definition of an object in JS we will first cover Object
    Literals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Object literals are a data structure that can hold a collection of key value
    pairs. We can call these key value pairs as an objects properties. Each
    property can be looked up by its key and a value is returned for whatever
    you chose to assigned to that key. See the example above.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    You can name a key whatever you please in the object as long as it follows
    the standard variable naming conventions in JavaScript. A key in an object, is like defining a variables name and the is whatever
    you decide to assign to that variable. Think of it as creating multiple variables
    inside of a block that can be of any other valid JavaScript type, including other object types
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The values you assign to each key can be any valid data structure in the
    JavaScript language. In other words you can assign a key to be OR return
    virtually anything. This includes all primitive data types we went over in
    the previous section and includes all Object data types that we will cover
    more in depth in this section, such as arrays, other objects, functions or
    return values from functions.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    As you can see, JS objects are pretty cool. And if we think about it a little
    longer we realize we can do some pretty cool things with this data structure. But lets continue to keep things simple.
    Here are some great examples and explanations on how these data structures work
    and how a JavaScript engine will evaluate these structures
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Object Literals</h4>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const</span> person1
      <span class="equal">= </span> <span class="pink">&#123;</span>
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">name: <span class="str">"Joe"</span></span>,
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">age: <span class="num">45</span></span>,
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">relations: <span class="yellow">&#91;&#93;</span></span>
      <br>
      <span class="pink">&#125;</span>;
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="const">const</span> person2
      <span class="equal">= </span> <span class="pink">&#123;</span>
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">name: <span class="str">"Ryan"</span></span>,
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">age: <span class="num">24</span></span>,
      <br>
      <span class="indent-1">relations: <span class="yellow">&#91;</span><span class="const">person1</span><span class="yellow">&#93;</span></span>
      <br>
      <span class="pink">&#125;</span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>We have already briefly discussed object literals in JavaScript above, but we never discussed how they are interpreted and the true power behind them. So let us dive in.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As you can see in the code above we have defined two object literals. They are defined by opening and closing curly braces and
    for each key within the object literal we place a semi-colon instead of an equal sign to assign values to each key within the object.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Also note that each key within the object literal is of a different type. Notably the relations array. This is really neat. Not only are we
    storing an array within an object, but the array is storing references to another object. This is powerful!
  </p>
  <p>Any programming language is capable of these features. But JavaScript and other high level languages have make it easy for us to create such data structures. We can easily access the first persons
    data if within our scope we only have access to person2's data. simply by dot or bracket notation or both. eg...
  </p>
  <div class="code">
    <code>
      <span class="const">const </span>
      <span>person1Name </span>
      <span class="equal">= </span>
      <span>person1.<span class="const">relations</span><span class="yellow">[</span><span class="num">0</span><span class="yellow">]</span>.<span class="const">name</span></span>;
    </code>
    <p>.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>This is amazing on so many levels. We just accessed person1's name through our person2 object. But do not take my word for this. Try it out yourself.</p>
  <br>
  <p>So how is this working? How does this objects references array store the entire state of person1 in it? The short answer is that it doesn't.</p>
  <br>
  <p>How does a JavaScript engine type and create an object? Here is a simplified high level list of the steps an engine would take to type and define an object in JS</p>
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li></li>
  </ol>
  <script>
    const codes = document.querySelectorAll(".code");
    codes.forEach((code) => code.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      const text = code.textContent;
      navigator.clipboard.writeText(text).then(
        () => {
          console.log("Copied");
        },
        (err) => {
          console.error("Unable to copy text: ", err);
        }
      )
    }))
  </script>
