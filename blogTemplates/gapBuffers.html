  <p>Today, let's talk about gap buffers</p>
  <br />
  <p>
   If you have never before heard of a gap buffer than you're in the right
   place! I knew nothing at all about them years into my programming career,
   until one day I felt like re-inventing the wheel.
  </p>
  <p>
   This all started a few days into a new blog application I was creating for
   one of my clients. Their demands were quite reasonable, and their main focus
   was having a great text editing experience.

  <h2 id="">Rich Text Editor Libraries</h2>
  <p>
   For starters I immediately went to libraries. I mean who wouldn't? My tech
   stack was something like this...
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>React</li>
   <li>Sanity.io (a headless CMS)</li>
   <li>And that's it!!....</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   So immediately the search was on. I checked out React Quill, React Rich Text
   Editor, Draft.js and countless others before settling in on a library called
   <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jodit-react"> jodit-react </a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   This was a great experience for me. I was learning a new library specific
   skill, and creating something cool. This library came with all of the fancy
   bells and whistles straight out of the box. Plus or minus a few paid version
   features.. <span>And there was the problem.</span>

  <script>
   const codes = document.querySelectorAll(".code");
   codes.forEach(code =>
    code.addEventListener("click", e => {
     e.preventDefault();
     const text = code.textContent;
     navigator.clipboard.writeText(text).then(
      () => {
       console.log("Copied");
      },
      err => {
       console.error("Unable to copy text: ", err);
      }
     );
    })
   );
  </script>
